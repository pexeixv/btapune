## Physical Benefits of Taekwondo for Children

The Physical benefits of Taekwondo will be immediately noticeable for children of all ages. The rudimentary self-defence moves of Taekwondo, such as kicking, Punching, Striking, and Blocking teach children coordination and concentration, as children become more advanced, they will learn the more dynamic techniques of Taekwondo, such as combinations kicks, jumping and spinning kicks. Overall, Taekwondo offers a full mind and body workout for children. The techniques and format of the classes are aerobic and engaging by bringing out the athlete in each child.

Unlike other after school sports, Taekwondo practice is extremely individual and personal to each child which may vary from student to student. Everyone participates equally in class and each students goal and achievement is unique and personal to him or herself. We monitor each student’s progress carefully and set individualized goals for them to achieve. Our objectives is to help all our students reach their potential in the martial arts field through Taekwondo, but more importantly, we hope our students will grow up strong and healthy with a solid foundation in physical fitness.

## Mental and Behavioral Benefits of Taekwondo

Brandons Taekwondo Academy is a traditional school of martial arts, and as such, the students are held to a high standard of discipline and conduct. Our students are taught to answer their instructors with “Yes Sir” or “Yes Ma’am” on the very first day and are then slowly introduced to the other basic workout, Through little courtesies like bowing students learn discipline and respect which often carry through to their homes and school lives. Beyond that, we also teach students the Tenets of Taekwondo and expect higher standards during practice. **The FIVE Tenets of Taekwondo are : Courtesy, Integrity, Perseverance, Self Control and Indomitable Spirit.** By focusing on these virtues, we try to develop self-esteem, kindness, confidence and spirit in all our students. We also ask our parents to participate in various other activities like Camping, Trekking, Tournaments, and every year we make it a point to celebrate our annual day on 31st August and reach out to the underprivileged or not so fortunate by organizing games, prizes, snacks or lunch/dinner, return gifts and donations collected from our very own students, parents and well wishers.
