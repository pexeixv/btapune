Subsequently, on November 15, 2002, they traveled to Seoul, South Korea, where they enrolled at the Sangrok World Taekwondo Academy. Enduring the harsh, frigid climate of Seoul with temperatures well below freezing became one of the most challenging times for Richard and his father. Despite facing numerous obstacles, Brandon, resolute and unwavering, persevered through these demanding conditions, displaying immense determination. Overcoming these adversities was crucial in achieving the personal, institutional, communal, and national goals they had set. Their experiences during this period not only strengthened their resolve but also instilled a sense of resilience that transcended the difficulties encountered, shaping their journey in martial arts.

Despite the freezing temperatures during his examination, Brandon displayed unwavering determination, confidence, and focus. His remarkable performance captivated the audience, consisting of visitors from Austria, Israel, and Koreans. Following the examination, an honoring celebration was arranged at the Sangrok World Taekwondo Academy to recognize Brandon's outstanding achievement.

Without the consent of the school authorities of St. Vincent’s, Brandon would never have been able to achieve FOUR National Records.

Brandon sets his eyes on his next goal, his 5th Dan, a long way to go.

## Brandon's Taekwondo Journey: From 4th Poom Black Belt to 5th Dan Black Belt – The Fruits of Patience

It was in the year 2002, 12 year old Brandon, at that time a 7th grade student of St. Vincent’s High School, Pune. Visited Seoul, South Korea to train & grade for his 4th Poom, which he achieved as on 5th March 2003 at age 12 years, 6 months & 5 days.

It was a long wait, 8 years of training in his capacity, in the year 2010 while pursuing his education in the United States, he was given to understand that one semester he could study anywhere outside the country, we asked Brandon if he could opt for South Korea so that he could attend college, train with the K-Tigers as well as appear for his 5th Dan at Kukkiwon, The World Taekwondo Federation Headquarters. We were glad to know that Brandon was granted permission by the college to visit korea. All formalities in terms of documentation, training fees and Kukkiwon, 5th Dan Black Belt fees were remitted to the concerned authorities. Brandon’s earlier visits to Korea was at the age of 6, 7, 9 and 12 years, always accompanied by his father as Coach, but now a 6 foot tall, 20 year old Brandon was all on his own visiting Korea for his 5th Dan.

It was in September till mid December 2010, Brandon was thrilled to be in Seoul the country known as the Morning Calm, the city that gave him so much in terms of Love, Affection, Training, and Grading, filled with this zeal and proud to be training under the expertise of the World’s best Demonstration Team, The K-Tigers.

Brandons training came in as a surprise, unexpected, hard core & tough, years and years of experience, a mentally strong and tough Brandon balanced himself well by attending college and training. Communicating with the K-Tigers was a problem as English was a barrier, he managed to brief them the purpose of his visit to train, prepare for his 5th Dan and grade at Kukkiwon as done in the past. The K-Tigers authorities told Brandon that he could not appear for his 5th Dan, reason being he was only 20 years of age and to be eligible u should acquire the age of 25. Brandon felt disheartened, his dreams were shattered, time, money, energy everything collapsed for this young Taekwondoist, inspite of his paper work, money paid in advance, communication with the authorities were placed well in advance and on knowing of his arrival and purpose of visit fell on deaf years.

Well it was a challenge for all of us specially for Brandon but being mentally strong and physically tough he took it positively in his stride and was happy to have made many friends, learning their culture and being blessed with the best training made him happy and content.

**Brandon had to accept the guide lines set forth by the governing body, since Brandon graduated as a Poom Black Belt at the age of 6 years, 1 month and 27 days.** Followed by the rest of his grades, from 4th Poom that he graduated on 5th March 2003, to appear for his 5th Dan Brandon had to wait for TEN years.

Kukkiwon refunded the 5th Dan fees paid to them with a covering letter stating that he can appear for his 5th Dan at the age of 22 years, in the year 2012.

It was during his visit to India during the 1st week of November 2012, still fresh the touch and skills he mastered from the K-Tigers still flowing in his blood saw him appear for his 5th Dan at the Brandons Taekwondo Academy at the S. M. Joshi school, Branch in Pune. The exam was conducted by Master Nilesh Jalnawala, 6th Dan Black Belt, Master Instructor, Kukkiwon, Director of JSTARC, Mumbai in the presence of Master Balkrishna Bhandari, 6th Dan Black Belt, Kukkiwon, Director of Horangee Taekwondo Academy, Pune. And Master Richard A. Fernandes, 6th Dan Black Belt, Kukkiwon, Director of Brandons Taekwondo Academy, Pune. In the presence of students and welwishers. It was a day of joy for all of us, a dream come true. We received the confirmation that Brandon cleared his exam and received his 5th Dan Black Belt Certification as on 5th March 2013. Ten Long Years.

**It is with great pride that as of today Brandon has achieved a milestone in Taekwondo as India’s Youngest 5th Dan Black Belt at the age of 22 years, 6 months and 5 days.**

With fingers crossed another long wait, Brandon has set his eyes on his next grade from 5th Dan to 6th Dan once he reaches the age of 30. God willing he will.
